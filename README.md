The app image tinting in the menu bar only works when the dark mode menu bar is enabled which I have enabled
at all times, so it is not issue for me.
It is also possible that this looks weird for other macOS versions, but for me it works on macOS High Sierra 10.13.6.

A left click in the menu brings the app to the foreground and a right click terminates the app.
